# Post-Generation Verification Checklist

Run through each category after generating an app. Fix any issues before presenting the result.

> **This is the canonical reference for mechanical checks.** `SKILL.md` phases 4.5, 5, and 5.5 point here rather than duplicating the grep commands inline, to prevent drift. If you update a grep or add a new one, update it here. The phases will inherit the change.
> Example paths assume a consumer project with the Foldkit subtree vendored at `repos/foldkit/`. Working inside the Foldkit repo itself, drop that prefix; the same paths exist at the project root.

## Gate commands (run ALL FOUR; fix everything they surface)

- [ ] `format`: run FIRST; rewrites files so subsequent gates see the committed shape. The scaffold wires Oxfmt.
- [ ] `lint`: output clean. This is the substantive structural gate, not just a style pass: the scaffold wires oxlint **and** `@foldkit/oxlint-plugin`, whose 24 `foldkit/*` rules enforce keyed rows, route printing, `Got*` wrapping, Command naming, and more. Treat any `foldkit(...)` diagnostic as a blocker; that is how they are labelled in the output. It also catches the unused imports `tsc` does not.
- [ ] `typecheck`: no errors. The scaffold wires `tsc --noEmit`.
- [ ] `test`: all tests pass. The scaffold wires vitest.

The project's configured script is the contract for each gate; the tools named
are what `create-foldkit-app` happens to wire up. If a project swapped one out,
run its script, not the tool named here.

Invoke each through the package manager the project was scaffolded with (`npm run lint`, `pnpm run lint`, `yarn lint`, `bun run lint`). If a script is missing, run the project-local binary through that manager's exec (`pnpm exec oxlint src`, `npm exec --no-install oxlint src`, `yarn exec oxlint src`, `bun x --no-install oxlint src`). Avoid bare `npx`, which fetches from the registry when the binary isn't installed locally.

"Typecheck clean and tests pass" is NOT sufficient. Generated code rarely matches Oxfmt's output out of the box, and frequently has unused imports (`Invalid`, `NotValidated`, `Valid` imported as values when only used as string-literal tag keys in `Match.tag(...)`) that only the linter catches. Skipping either means the user's first `git commit` produces a cascade of formatting/lint fixes they have to clean up.

## Mechanical scans (run on every file before tsc)

**Run the linter before any of these.** `@foldkit/oxlint-plugin` ships 24 AST
rules, all `error` in its `recommended.json`, and `create-foldkit-app` installs
and wires it, so `npm run lint` already enforces them in a scaffolded project.
Those rules are the real structural check: they parse the code instead of
matching text, so they don't miss a wrapped call or a renamed helper the way a
grep does. Confirm the rules are actually active rather than that the package is named
somewhere, and read the config to confirm it rather than the lint output: a
monorepo or vendored setup wires the plugin by path specifier under `jsPlugins`
and never extends `recommended.json`. Diagnostics are labelled
`foldkit(rule-name)`, so grepping for `foldkit/` finds nothing even when every
rule is running, and a run with zero `foldkit(` matches is what a passing project
looks like. Never read a quiet lint run as the rules being off.
If the rules aren't active, turning them on is a bigger win than any scan below.

Among others, the plugin enforces keyed mapped rows, hard-coded route strings,
empty-object tagged calls, `Rel` on external links, spread inside `modifyFields`, `Got*`
wrapping of child output, PascalCase `Command.define` bindings, and no `NoOp`
Messages. Don't re-implement a rule wholesale.

**A rule being green is not the same as the subject being clean.** Several rules
are deliberately narrow, and the greps below deliberately cover their edges. Each
such grep says which rule it complements and where that rule stops. Note also
that `recommended.json` turns every rule off for `**/*.test.ts` and
`**/*.test.tsx`, so the linter
contributes nothing to test files; Scene and Story shape is on you.

The rest of the block covers ground no rule touches: API drift where a name moved
between packages, `@foldkit/ui` component adoption, Effect idiom, a11y detail,
and test shape. Each hit is either a fix or a `// NOTE:` justification. Silent
hits aren't allowed. Phase 4.5 of SKILL.md runs this block; the reviewer in
Phase 6 runs it again as sanity.

Alongside the greps, eyeball each file's imports. Every symbol you imported should be called. The linter flags this, but so do you, at write-time.

## Structural completeness

- [ ] Every Message variant is declared once in `defineMessageUnion()`
- [ ] Every Message variant has a case in `Message.match` in update
- [ ] Every route variant has a corresponding view branch
- [ ] Every `Succeeded*` has a paired `Failed*`
- [ ] Every discriminated union variant is handled in both update and view

## Purity

- [ ] update function has no side effects (no DOM, no randomness, no I/O)
- [ ] view function has no side effects
- [ ] init function has no side effects (returns Commands for startup work)
- [ ] No `let` declarations anywhere
- [ ] No mutation (`.push()`, `.splice()`, object mutation)
- [ ] No `Effect.runSync` / `Effect.runPromise` outside of Commands

## Commands

- [ ] Every Command identity defined with `Command.define` and assigned to a PascalCase constant
- [ ] No inline `Command.define` in pipe chains. Always stored as a constant
- [ ] Definitions colocated with the update that produces them
- [ ] Every _fallible_ Command catches all errors: `Effect.catch(() => Effect.succeed(Message.FailedX(...)))`. Infallible Effects (`Clock.currentTimeMillis`, `Random.nextIntBetween`, `Calendar.today.local`) do NOT need catch. If the type system shows no error channel, there's nothing to catch, and no paired `Failed*` Message is needed either. UUID generation via `Crypto.Crypto` uses `Effect.orDie` instead of a `Failed*` Message; a crypto failure is a defect, not a domain error.
- [ ] Return types inferred. No explicit `Command<typeof A>` annotations
- [ ] Factory functions named by action: `fetchWeather`, not `fetchWeatherCommand`
- [ ] Commands that can't meaningfully fail return `Completed*` Messages, payload-carrying ones included

## Mount, Command, Subscription, ManagedResource, CustomElement: pick by what causes the side effect

- [ ] **One-time effect after a Message dispatched** → Command. Focus-on-open, navigation, network, storage, analytics, scroll lock paired with a modal opening/closing all belong in `update`'s return, not in `OnMount`.
- [ ] **Per-instance lifecycle bound to a VNode existing**, where the live `Element` handle is needed → Mount. Anchor positioning, backdrop portaling, attaching observers/listeners to a specific element, third-party library instantiation that takes the element as host. Two constructors picked by emission cardinality: `Mount.define(name, { messages, execute: ({ element }) => Effect<Message> })` for one-shot Mounts that produce exactly one Message at acquire (anchor setup, portal-to-body, library instantiation); `Mount.defineStream(name, { messages, execute: ({ element }) => Stream<Message> })` for continuous-event Mounts where the element produces a stream of events from listeners or observers (scroll listeners, IntersectionObservers, MutationObservers). Per-instance inputs go in `args`, and `execute` receives them alongside `element`. Both compose cleanup via `Effect.acquireRelease` and keep the scope open until destroy.
- [ ] **External event source gated by a Model condition** → Subscription. Timers, document/window events, system theme changes, WebSocket message streams. The factory returns `Stream<Message>` whose lifetime is gated by `modelToDependencies`. Subscriptions look like `Mount.defineStream` in shape (Stream + `Effect.acquireRelease` cleanup), but the cause anchor differs: Mount = element existence, Subscription = Model condition.
- [ ] **Stateful runtime object** (websocket, camera stream, library instance) keyed on a Model condition, with Commands consuming the handle via `yield*` → ManagedResource. Not a generic "lifecycle on Model condition". There must be a handle for Commands to use.
- [ ] **Native web component** (Shoelace, vanilla-colorful, emoji-picker-element, anything that speaks typed JS properties + observed attributes + dispatched `CustomEvent`s) → CustomElement. Side-effect-import the package to register the element with the browser, then declare its surface with `CustomElement.define({ tag, properties, events })` to get a typed inline builder. Do NOT reach for Mount + Subscription + tag-name registry to wrap a web component; `CustomElement.define` is the higher-level fit when those three surfaces are available.

### Two practical rules for Mount (both must hold)

- [ ] **`execute` uses the element it receives.** If `execute` doesn't read or write the element, Mount is the wrong primitive. Pick Command (transition-driven) or paired Commands (lifecycle-bound but element-handle-not-used).
- [ ] **The work is DOM measurement, DOM manipulation, or continuous element-scoped event listening on that element.** Read geometry, mutate CSS, attach an observer/listener, portal the element, hand it to a third-party library. Anything else (network, storage, analytics, focus-on-transition, scroll lock for the page) is a Command.

### Replay safety

- [ ] A Mount's `execute` runs again during DevTools time-travel renders. The two rules above keep Mount work inherently replay-safe (read-only DOM measurement, idempotent DOM mutation, paired observer attachment+cleanup via `Effect.acquireRelease`). If your Mount touches the live world in a way that disrupts replay (focus stealing, scroll locking the live page, library re-instantiation), it shouldn't be a Mount.

### Smell check

- [ ] **Don't reach for Mount just because the work happens to coincide with an element appearing.** Check what causes the work. If a Message just dispatched (e.g. `Opened*`, `Submitted*`), the cause is the Message, not the element. Use a Command returned from `update`'s handler. Example: focusing a search input when its dialog opens. The cause is `Opened`, not the input's existence; return a `FocusInput` Command from the `Opened` handler.
- [ ] **`Effect.acquireRelease` construction lives INSIDE the acquire body, not before it.** If your acquire body reads as `Effect.sync(() => alreadyExistingValue)`, the construction happened earlier and your release is dangling. `acquireRelease` only guarantees atomicity of "acquire body completes → release is registered"; anything constructed outside the acquire body, even one `yield*` earlier, is unprotected against interruption. Fix: express the construction as the success value of the acquire Effect (`Effect.tryPromise(...).pipe(Effect.map(({ Lib }) => new Lib(...)))` for async imports, `Effect.sync(() => new Thing(...))` for sync construction). Applies anywhere `acquireRelease` is used: a Mount's `execute`, Subscription bodies, anywhere a release function depends on a value produced inside an Effect chain.

### Naming

- [ ] Mount Definition names are verb-first imperatives: `AnchorPopover`, `PortalPopoverBackdrop`, `AttachComboboxPreventBlur`, not `PopoverAnchor` or `ComboboxPreventBlurAttachment`. Mount result Messages are verb-first past-tense: `CompletedAnchorPopover`.

## Naming

- [ ] Messages are past-tense, verb-first
- [ ] Input changes use `Updated*` prefix (e.g. `UpdatedEmail`), not `Changed*`
- [ ] `Completed*` uses verb+object order: `CompletedFocusInput` not `CompletedInputFocus`
- [ ] Option fields prefixed with `maybe`
- [ ] Boolean fields prefixed with `is`
- [ ] No opaque abbreviations or unexplained single-letter names
- [ ] Constants for all magic numbers
- [ ] Schema literals are capitalized: `Schema.Literals(['Active', 'Inactive'])`

## State modeling

- [ ] Discriminated unions for multi-valued state (not booleans)
- [ ] `Option` for absent fields (not empty strings, null, or zero)
- [ ] Impossible states are unrepresentable
- [ ] `defineTaggedUnion()` for non-Message domain unions and Model states
- [ ] `defineRouteUnion()` for Routes
- [ ] `taggedStruct()` only when the variants cannot be declared together
- [ ] `defineMessageUnion()` for Message and OutMessage unions
- [ ] **Remote data uses `AsyncData`, not a hand-rolled union.** `AsyncData.Schema(DataSchema, ErrorSchema)` supplies `Idle`, `Loading`, `Refreshing`, `Failure`, `Stale`, and `Success` plus `match`, `isPending`, `hasData`, `revalidate`, and the rest. A hand-rolled `Idle | Loading | Error | Ok` is missing `Refreshing` and `Stale`, which is what forces a refetch to blank the screen and a failed refetch to discard good data. Reference: `repos/foldkit/examples/weather/src/main.ts`

## Framework modules over hand-rolled equivalents

Foldkit ships these; reaching past them is a finding, not a style choice.

- [ ] A return type used only at `Message.match` is written inline as `Update.Return<Model, Message>` or `Update.ReturnWithOutMessage<Model, Message, OutMessage>`. An `UpdateReturn` alias exists only when another matcher, helper, or exported signature reuses it. The update signature does not repeat the type already supplied to the match. A hand-written plain-return type includes `outMessage?: never`
- [ ] Update, init, boot, and component helper producers omit `commands` when they statically create no Commands. They return computed Commands collections directly without checking whether the collection is empty. They never write the literal `commands: []`
- [ ] Update, init, boot, and component helper results are bound to values named after their operations and consumed with dot access, not destructured or renamed. Name collisions use a trailing underscore such as `init_`; child `write` parameters use `next<Field>`
- [ ] Optional Commands pass directly to `Command.mapMessages`; `result.commands ?? []` appears only where an operation requires a concrete array
- [ ] Dot access keeps the operation and all of its returned fields visible together but does not prevent someone from ignoring `outMessage`
- [ ] One child init or boot result entering a parent Model uses `Update.foldChildInit`; several child results entering one parent Model use `Update.foldChildInits`; a child update that receives input uses `Update.foldChild`; a child helper that receives only its Model uses `Update.foldChildStep`
- [ ] An OutMessage that is already known is included directly in a new result. `Update.withOutMessage` is used for an existing plain return or a value with the type `OutMessage | undefined`: an existing return is piped into the helper, while a new result literal is passed first. No local equivalent helper or conditional spread duplicates it
- [ ] Child folds include `toParentOutMessage` only when at least one child OutMessage should continue to the current Submodel's parent. Partial forwarding matches every child variant and returns `undefined` for variants that stop here. The property is omitted when every variant stops here, and no `toParentOutMessage: () => undefined` mapping appears
- [ ] Two-or-more-step post-mutation handlers use `Update.combine(model, [...])` and `Update.refresh({ read, revalidate, write, load })` rather than hand-threaded `modifyFields` chains and conditional Command arrays. One Step is not wrapped in `Update.combine`, and an inline Step parameter is named `stepModel`
- [ ] `Update.foldChildInit`, `Update.foldChildInits`, `Update.foldChild`, or `Update.foldChildStep` re-tag child Submodel Commands through `toParentMessage` when applicable; direct `Command.mapMessages` is reserved for lower-level helpers and route-gated initialization
- [ ] HTTP uses `HttpClient` / `HttpClientRequest` from `effect/unstable/http`, with `Effect.provide(effect, Http.layer)` to supply the client. Not `@effect/platform` (`@effect/platform-browser` is separate and is for `BrowserKeyValueStore` / `BrowserCrypto`)
- [ ] UI components are imported from `@foldkit/ui` by name (`import { Dialog, Input } from '@foldkit/ui'`). There is no `Ui` namespace on `foldkit`

## Effect-TS patterns

- [ ] `pipe()` keeps a meaningful transformed value as the subject of left-to-right data flow; ordinary single calls stay direct
- [ ] `Message.match` for exhaustive Message matching; a declared domain or Route union's `match` / `matchOrElse` for exhaustive / partial matching; Effect `Match` for partial Message matches, shared multi-tag handlers, and unions without their own matcher (no switch)
- [ ] `Array.match({ onEmpty, onNonEmpty })` for branching on a Model array (not `.length === 0` / `.length > 0`, and not `Array.isArrayEmpty` / `Array.isArrayNonEmpty`, which take a mutable `Array<A>` and reject the `ReadonlyArray` that `Schema.Array(...)` decodes to)
- [ ] `modifyFields()` for Model updates (not spread)
- [ ] Callable constructors (not `as` casts or manual `_tag` objects)
- [ ] Message and OutMessage constructors stay on their owning namespace; no constructor destructuring
- [ ] No-field tagged structs called with NO argument: `Idle()`, `Work()`, `Message.ClickedSubmit()`. Never `Idle({})`, `Work({})`, `Message.ClickedSubmit({})`
- [ ] `Option.match` preferred over `Option.map` + `Option.getOrElse`

## View

- [ ] Branches are never keyed; each branch renders through a view function (identity boundary), with a same-tag inline ternary extracted into named view functions when switching must reset DOM state
- [ ] Events dispatch Messages, never perform actions directly
- [ ] Semantic HTML elements (`main`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`)

## Foldkit UI

- [ ] Foldkit UI components used where interaction matches (Dialog, Tabs, Menu, Combobox, DatePicker, FileDrop, Toast, Tooltip, DragAndDrop, etc.). Never hand-roll accessible widgets
- [ ] **Form inputs use `Input.view`, `Textarea.view`, `Button.view` from `@foldkit/ui`.** Hand-rolled `input`/`textarea`/`button` elements in a form are a fail unless the file has a NOTE comment explaining why the component couldn't be used.
- [ ] Each stateful UI component has its Model in the app Model, a `Got*` Message, init in init, and delegation in update. Stateless render helpers (`Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Fieldset`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Disclosure`, `Nav`) are called directly in view and dispatch parent Messages; the controlled ones (`Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Disclosure`) take the current value in from the parent Model, which stores the new value on toggle
- [ ] `Toast` uses `Toast.make(PayloadSchema)` to bind to a consumer-defined payload type
- [ ] No custom keyboard navigation or ARIA attributes for patterns covered by Foldkit UI components

### Mechanical check: no hand-rolling

Run these greps against `src/`. Every hit needs an explanation: a sanctioned `toView` spread, a `NOTE:` justification, or a fix.

```bash
# Raw input / textarea / button: should use Input, Textarea, Button.
# Matches both `input(...)` and the usual `h.input(...)`, anywhere on the line.
grep -rnE "(^|[^.[:alnum:]_])(h\.)?(input|textarea|button)\(" src/

# Hand-rolled ARIA: should use Dialog / Menu / Tabs. Capital-R `Role(` is the
# view attribute; lowercase `role(` is a test locator and is not a finding.
grep -rnE "(^|[^.[:alnum:]_])(h\.)?Role\(['\"](dialog|menu|tab)" src/
```

Eyeball every hit from the first grep. A call that spreads the component's own
attribute group (`...attributes.input`, `...attributes.textarea`,
`...attributes.button`) is the sanctioned `toView` case, not a finding. The spread
usually sits on a later line than the element call, which is why this exclusion is
a read rather than a `grep -v`.

The rule: **if the interaction pattern appears in the `@foldkit/ui` component table (Phase 2.5 of SKILL.md), use the component.** The gate is about the interaction, not the tag, so a hit is only a finding once you know which of these it is:

- **Inside the component's own `toView`** (the call spreads `...attributes.input` / `.textarea` / `.button` / `.label`): sanctioned, not a finding.
- **A form control** (a text input, textarea, or button in a form): must go through `Input`, `Textarea`, or `Button`. Raw here is a BLOCKER unless a `// NOTE: hand-rolling because <specific reason>` comment sits above it.
- **A deliberate non-form control** (a search field, an inline editor, anything intentionally below the component layer, per the form-inputs rule in Phase 2.5): allowed. Still check it directly against the Accessibility section below, since nothing is supplying the label wiring, focus ring, or ARIA for you.

Hand-rolling a control the table covers is permitted only when the component genuinely doesn't fit, and only with the NOTE. Without the NOTE, the reviewer treats it as a BLOCKER, not a style preference.

**A NOTE is not a free pass.** Before writing one, read the component's `.d.ts` and confirm the concern is real. Common false-justifications to avoid:

- _"Using the component would require a per-row Model instance and duplicate state"_: first check whether the component is stateful. Stateless controlled helpers like `Checkbox`, `Switch`, and `Disclosure` do not add a child Model. Store the value in the parent Model and pass it to `view` with an `onToggle` Message. For stateful components, the component Model holds UI state (focus, open/closed, typeahead key buffer), not your domain value, so holding it is not duplication.
- _"The component needs a toParentMessage and I don't want to wire one"_: that's always the wiring cost. The whole point of Ui components is that you pay it once per use and get a11y for free.
- _"The interaction is too custom for the component"_: check the `toView` callback signature. It lets you render whatever HTML you want inside the component's attribute-scaffolding. Custom visual = fine, custom a11y = never needed.

Reviewers should challenge every NOTE: "Is this justification actually true, or is it defensive rationalization? What does the `.d.ts` say?" Look up the component's actual API before accepting the NOTE.

## Accessibility

Foldkit UI components ARE the a11y pass for their covered patterns. These checks apply to anything NOT covered by a `@foldkit/ui` component (raw inputs in a custom context, static content, custom layouts) and to the overall document structure.

- [ ] Exactly one `h1` per route. Headings descend without skipping levels (no `h3` without an `h2` above it).
- [ ] Semantic landmarks used: `main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `section`. Not `div` soup.
- [ ] Every `label` is associated with its input: `label([For('email-input')], ['Email'])` paired with `input([Id('email-input'), ...])`. Or use `Input.view` which handles the association. Grep the `label(` calls and read each one's attribute block for `For(`; a single-line `grep -v` misses labels whose attributes wrap. A `...attributes.label` spread is the component's own `toView` and is not a finding.
- [ ] Every `input`, `textarea`, and `select` has either an associated `label` OR an explicit `AriaLabel(...)`. Unlabeled form fields are a fail.
- [ ] Icon-only buttons have `AriaLabel(...)` describing the action. `button([OnClick(...)], ['★'])` without an aria label is unreadable to screen readers.
- [ ] Dynamic error messages wrap in `role="alert"` (for immediate errors) or `aria-live="polite"` (for non-urgent updates). Validation errors that appear after blur should be announced. Example: `p([Role('alert'), ...], [errorMessage])`. Grep for error-class CSS (e.g. `text-red`) and verify each error container has `Role('alert')` or a parent with `AriaLive('polite')`.
- [ ] External links (`Target('_blank')`) also have `Rel('noopener noreferrer')`.
- [ ] Images have `Alt(...)`. Decorative images use `Alt('')` explicitly. Never omitted.
- [ ] Interactive lists (navigable items, selectable rows) use `ul`/`ol` + `li`, not `div` stacks. Screen readers announce "list with N items" for real lists.
- [ ] Required form fields are marked `AriaRequired(true)` on the rendered input. `Input.view` has no `required` option, so pass it through the `toView` callback's `input` attribute group. The `required` HTML attribute alone is not enough for every screen reader.
- [ ] Focus is visible, either via Tailwind's `focus-visible:` classes or the browser default. If you've reset outline, you must replace it. Grep for `outline-none` without a paired `focus-visible:` class.
- [ ] Color is not the only carrier of meaning. A red border on an invalid input needs an accompanying error message or icon. Don't ship "invalid = red only."
- [ ] Page `<title>` is set via the `title` field of the `Document` returned by `view` (with `Runtime.makeApplication`). For routed apps, each route returns a distinct title.

### Mechanical check: a11y

The greps below are **fast starting scans**, not authoritative. `foldkit/require-rel-for-external-link` is the real check for the external-link case, but it bails when the attribute array contains a spread, so the scan stays for that edge. Attributes also span multiple lines (`Target('_blank')` on line N, `Rel('noopener noreferrer')` several lines later, or ordered the other way), so a fixed `-A` window silently passes anchors whose `Rel` falls outside it. Each scan lists candidates; you confirm by reading the whole attribute block. Every hit needs eyeballing in context before it is called a bug, and every hit does need it.

```bash
grep -rnE "(^|[^.[:alnum:]_])(h\.)?label\(" src/       # labels: read each block for For(
grep -rn "_blank" src/                                  # then read each anchor's block for Rel(
                                                        # foldkit/require-rel-for-external-link
                                                        # bails on spread attribute arrays
grep -rn "outline-none" src/ | grep -v "focus-visible:"  # killed focus outline without replacement
```

For a precise check, read each matching attribute block end-to-end. Alternatively, convert to a short AST-level scan or a structural lint rule; those are the real defense. The greps are for catching obvious misses in under a second.

Each confirmed miss is a concrete a11y bug a screen reader user would hit.

## Forms, dates, and files

- [ ] Form validation uses `foldkit/fieldValidation` (`Field`, `makeRules`, `validate`, `allValid`). No hand-rolled `Valid | Invalid` unions when validation is the concern
- [ ] Date handling uses the `Calendar` module (`Calendar.CalendarDate`, `Calendar.today.local`). No raw `Date` objects in Model
- [ ] File handling uses the `File` module with `FileDrop` from `@foldkit/ui`. No direct `File` API usage in update/view

## File organization

- [ ] Message layout follows four-group convention (values, union + type)
- [ ] Section headers used in single-file apps: `// MODEL`, `// MESSAGE`, etc.
- [ ] Complex update handlers extracted to separate functions
- [ ] view decomposed when branches exceed ~30 lines

## Testing

**Story tests** (required at every tier):

- [ ] `story.test.ts` exists with `story` pipelines (sibling pages or component variants use a subject prefix: `login.story.test.ts`)
- [ ] Every fallible Command (`Succeeded*`/`Failed*` pair) tested for both outcomes
- [ ] At least one multi-step test that chains Messages and Command resolutions
- [ ] Submodel tests assert `outMessage` when the child signals to parent
- [ ] Tests use `Command.resolve(Definition, resultMessage)`. Never run Command Effects directly in story tests
- [ ] All tests pass with the project's test script

**Scene tests** (REQUIRED at Tier 3+; strongly encouraged at Tier 2):

For Tier 3+ apps (routing, async Commands, forms), missing `scene.test.ts` is a **BLOCKER**. The app has not been tested from the user's perspective without it.

- [ ] `scene.test.ts` exists: a root-level file for flows that cross pages, plus one in any page folder whose own rendering and interaction warrant it
- [ ] View rendering test: initial view has expected elements (headings, inputs, buttons)
- [ ] User interactions test: click, type, submit produce visible changes
- [ ] At minimum one test per discriminated-union state that has distinct view output (loading, error, empty, populated)
- [ ] Uses accessible locators: `role(...)`, `label(...)`, `text(...)`. Not `placeholder` or CSS selectors.
- [ ] Scoped queries with `within` or `inside` when a parent container contains multiple similar elements

# Quality Bar (beyond "it works")

The sections above cover correctness. The sections below cover the craft details that distinguish typing-game / website quality from generic valid code. The bar is: would a careful reader believe this was hand-written by the authors of `packages/typing-game/client/src/` or `packages/website/src/`? If not, keep working.

**Tier-aware:** every item below applies at every tier UNLESS marked otherwise:

- `[T2+]`: applies once the app has subscriptions or persisted state
- `[T3+]`: applies once the app has async Commands or routing
- `[T5+]`: applies once the app has nested domain state, multiple entities, or submodels

Items without a tier marker apply universally (even to a 50-line counter). When in doubt, assume universal.

## Decomposition

- [ ] Every function operates at a single abstraction level: orchestrators delegate, implementations implement. If a function reads like it's doing two things, extract one.
- [ ] **Update handlers over ~15 lines are extracted** to named functions in the same file. [T3+] If a handler exceeds ~50 lines, extract to its own file under `src/update/` (e.g. `update/handleRoomUpdates.ts`).
- [ ] **Extracted handlers are curried `(model: Model) => (message: M) => UpdateReturn`** so they compose in pipelines, not `(model, message) => UpdateReturn`. See `packages/typing-game/client/src/page/home/update/handleKeyPressed.ts:33-40`.
- [ ] **View branches over ~30 lines are extracted** to named view functions (e.g. `enterUsernameView`, `selectActionView`). [T5+] If the view for a single route/state exceeds ~100 lines, extract to `src/view/` or `src/page/*/view.ts`.
- [ ] No function exceeds ~40 lines without extraction. Long functions are the primary smell.

## Effect module usage (consistency, not correctness)

- [ ] Native methods replaced with Effect equivalents _in pipe chains_: `Array.map(items, f)` not `items.map(f)` when composing; `String.startsWith(s, 'foo')` in a pipe not `s.startsWith('foo')`.
- [ ] `Option.match({ onNone, onSome })` preferred over `Option.map(...).pipe(Option.getOrElse(...))`. The labeled branches are self-documenting.
- [ ] `Array.match({ onEmpty, onNonEmpty })` when handling both empty and non-empty cases, and for any branch on a Model array at all, since the predicates reject `ReadonlyArray`. Not `isArrayEmpty ? ... : ...` ternaries. Grep for `.length > 0`, `.length === 0`, and `.length !== 0` on arrays and strings; should be zero. Use `Array.isArrayNonEmpty` / `String.isNonEmpty` for pure checks, `Array.match` for branching renders.
- [ ] `Equal.equals(target)` in predicates: `Array.findFirst(items, Equal.equals('Other'))` not `item => item === 'Other'`.
- [ ] `Array.fromOption(maybeCommand)` for "zero or one command based on Option", not `Option.match` that returns `[]` vs `[cmd]`.
- [ ] `Option.liftPredicate(value, predicate)` instead of `condition ? Option.some(value) : Option.none()`. The predicate may be a constant `() => condition` when the check doesn't use the value.
- [ ] A single-transformation `pipe` has a clear data-flow reading, such as `pipe(dialogClose, Update.withOutMessage(outMessage))`; a pipe that only rearranges ordinary function application is called directly
- [ ] In multi-line pipes, data leads on its own line: `pipe(\n  data,\n  Array.map(f),\n  ...\n)`, not `pipe(data, Array.map(f), ...)`.
- [ ] `modifyFields` setters are point-free when they only transform that same field: `entries: Array.map(f)` not `entries: () => Array.map(model.entries, f)`, `count: Number.increment` not `count: () => Number.increment(model.count)`. Keep `() => value` for replacement values from Messages, child updates, Commands, or other Model fields.
- [ ] Callback destructuring when accessing a single field: `({ id }) => id === cardId` not `card => card.id === cardId`.

## Domain organization [T5+]

- [ ] **If the app has multiple domain entities referenced across modules, they live in `src/domain/`**, not inline in `model.ts`. One file per concept (`domain/column.ts`, `domain/card.ts`), with `domain/index.ts` as a barrel re-exporting each via namespaced re-export (`export * as Column from './column'`).
- [ ] **Pure domain logic lives in `domain/*.ts`**, not in update handlers. Examples: `Column.reorder(columns, from, to)`, `Cart.totalPrice(items)`. If the update is doing array surgery on domain entities, that surgery belongs in the domain module.
- [ ] Domain files export schemas AND pure operations on those schemas. Update calls the operations; it doesn't reimplement them.
- [ ] Domain modules never import from `model.ts`, `update.ts`, `view.ts`, or `message.ts`. Domain is the leaf layer.
- [ ] References: `repos/foldkit/examples/kanban/src/domain/`, `repos/foldkit/examples/job-application/src/domain/`, `repos/foldkit/examples/shopping-cart/src/domain/`.

## Naming precision

- [ ] Every Option-typed value is prefixed `maybe*`: `maybeCurrentUser`, `maybeFocusUsernameInput`, `maybeOutMessage`, `maybeNewCardColumnId`. No exceptions.
- [ ] No `maybe*` name holds a native `T | undefined`; `maybe*` is reserved for `Option`. Grep `maybe[A-Z]` against function signatures and variable types; each hit should be `Option<T>`, not `T | undefined`.
- [ ] Internal API boundaries (helper function configs, view builders, domain operations) use `Option<T>` for optional fields, not `T | undefined`. Call sites then read `Option.some(x)` / `Option.none()` instead of `x` / `undefined`. The `T | undefined` form is only acceptable at framework boundaries (React props, vendored library configs, JSON decoding) that already use it.
- [ ] Boolean fields prefixed `is*`: `isPlaying`, `isDismissed`, `isMenuOpen`.
- [ ] Command function names are verbs describing the action: `fetchWeather`, `focusButton`, `scrollToItem`. Never `fetchWeatherCommand` or `weatherFetcher`.
- [ ] Command `define` names are verb-first PascalCase imperatives: `FetchWeather`, `FocusButton`, `LockScroll`.
- [ ] Command names describe the effect their `execute` bodies perform, not the later Model transition: a timer that only waits before dismissal is `WaitBeforeDismissal`, not `DismissAfter`.
- [ ] Message names are verb-first past-tense: `ClickedSubmit`, `UpdatedEmail`, `SucceededFetchWeather`. Never noun-first (`SubmitClicked`) or imperative (`FetchWeather` as a Message).
- [ ] `Completed*` Messages mirror the Command name verb-first: Command `LockScroll` → Message `CompletedLockScroll`. Never `CompletedScrollLock`.
- [ ] A Command's result Message is named from the Command, not from the fact it reports: `DetermineStartTime` → `CompletedDetermineStartTime`, never `DeterminedStartTime`. The only exception is a Message with more than one cause.
- [ ] Named helpers use specific verbs, not generic ones: `enqueueMessage` not `addMessage`, `announceKeyboardDrag` not `announce`, `whenSelectAction` not `handleSelect`. The verb eliminates ambiguity.
- [ ] Names are immediately understandable in context: `signature` not `sig`, `tickCount` not `t`, `message` not `msg`, `index` not `i`. Callback parameters are included. Conventional technical shorthand is allowed when it is the normal domain spelling, such as `attrs`, `props`, `args`, `dir`, `ctx`, `fn`, `DOM`, `URL`, and `VNode`. Established API and DSL bindings such as `h` are also allowed. Prefer a precise semantic name such as `toMessage` over an unexplained `f`.

## File structure and exports

- [ ] Each source file exports only its public contract: typically `Model`, `Message`, `init`, `update`, `view`, plus named schemas/constants other modules consume. Internal helpers are not exported.
- [ ] Section headers present in files that span multiple sections: `// MODEL`, `// MESSAGE`, `// INIT`, `// UPDATE`, `// COMMAND`, `// VIEW`, `// RUN`. Order: Model → Message → Flags (if any) → Init → Update → Command → View → Run.
- [ ] `index.ts` is always a barrel, never implementation. If a module `foo/` has code, the shape is `foo/foo.ts` for code + `foo/index.ts` for `export * from './foo'` and `export * as Child from './child'`.
- [ ] Imports ordered: npm packages first (alphabetized), then `foldkit/*`, then relative imports. No mixed groups.
- [ ] Message unions are exported as values and types when used across modules. Variants stay on the owning namespace: `Message.ClickedSave()`, never a separate `ClickedSave` export. Internal-only Message unions stay unexported.

## Submodel and Command extraction [T5+]

- [ ] [T5+] If the app has multiple Submodels, each has its own directory with at minimum `main.ts` (init/update/view), `message.ts` (messages + OutMessage schema), and optionally `command.ts` (submodel Commands).
- [ ] [T3+] If update returns Commands across multiple handlers AND the Commands involve non-trivial Effect pipelines (HTTP, Dom compositions), Commands are defined in their own `command.ts` file, not inline in update.
- [ ] Command factories are pre-wrapped and named by action: `const fetchWeather = (city) => ...` returns the Command-wrapped Effect. Call sites read as `[fetchWeather(city)]`, not `[FetchWeather(Effect.gen(...))]`.
- [ ] [T5+] OutMessage unions are explicitly tagged with `// OUT MESSAGE` section comment when they appear in a submodel `message.ts`.

## Subscriptions [T2+]

- [ ] Subscriptions use `Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({ key: entry(fields, callbacks) }))`. Each `entry(...)` call takes the bare field map as its first argument (no `Schema.Struct` wrap) and the `{ modelToDependencies, dependenciesToStream, equivalence? }` callbacks as its second.
- [ ] `modelToDependencies` extracts exactly the data the stream needs from Model, not the full Model. Wrap absent dependencies in `Option` at the field level when the subscription should stop.
- [ ] Always-active subscriptions pass `{}` as the `entry` fields argument and return `{}` from `modelToDependencies`.
- [ ] Message mapping happens inside `Stream.map(event => Effect.succeed(Message.UpdatedX({ data: event })))`, not scattered through update.
- [ ] Subscription files live at `src/subscription.ts` (or `src/subscription/` directory for multiple), never inline in `main.ts`.

## Managed Resources [T7]

- [ ] Managed Resources use `ManagedResource.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({ key: entry(requirementsSchema, config) }))`. The requirements schema is the positional first argument (usually `Schema.Option(...)`), not a field on `config`. No standalone `ManagedResourceDeps` struct.
- [ ] `modelToMaybeRequirements` returns `Option.some(params)` to acquire and `Option.none()` to release. `acquire` fails into the error channel so `onAcquireError` fires instead of crashing; `release` never throws.
- [ ] The service union is read with `ManagedResource.ServicesOf<typeof managedResources>`, not hand-maintained in parallel.
- [ ] A child Submodel that owns a Managed Resource exposes its own `make` record in child terms; the parent composes it with `ManagedResource.lift(childRecord)<Parent, Parent>({ toChildModel, toParentMessage })` (where `toChildModel` returns `Option<ChildModel>`) and `ManagedResource.aggregate`. No hand-rolled parent factory threading `toChildModel`/`toParentMessage` into the child.

## Testing quality

- [ ] Test names state the behavior being tested: `it('surfaces a validation error when email is malformed')`, not `it('tests validation')` or `it('handles the reported bug')`.
- [ ] Each `story` pipeline reads as a narrative: initial model → action → assert → action → assert. Not a dump of unrelated assertions.
- [ ] Scene tests use accessible locators (`role('button', { name: /submit/i })`, `label('Email')`) over `placeholder` or CSS selectors.
- [ ] Commands in tests are resolved with `Command.resolve(Definition, resultMessage)`. Never run Command Effects directly.

## Residual code smells (each is a fail)

- [ ] No `console.log`, `console.error`, or any `console.*` outside of test fixtures.
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks. Delete, don't comment.
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME/XXX comments in generated code. If something's incomplete, it shouldn't ship.
- [ ] No `any` types. No `as` casts except where Schema decoders require them at boundaries (and those should be vanishingly rare).
- [ ] No `let` outside tight imperative loops where mutation is genuinely unavoidable (rare; usually `Array.reduce` or `Array.makeBy` replaces it).
- [ ] No inline magic numbers in logic: `if (count > 5)` → `const FINAL_PHOTO_INDEX = 5; if (count > FINAL_PHOTO_INDEX)`.
- [ ] No dead code, unused imports, unused exports, or stub types (`type Foo = {}`).
- [ ] No `globalThis.*` references. Use Effect equivalents.
- [ ] No `T[]` syntax; always `Array<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`.

## Final exemplar comparison

Pick one generated file at random and read it next to the equivalent file in `packages/typing-game/client/src/` or `packages/website/src/page/`. Ask:

- Does the generated file look like it was written by the same hand? If you swapped it into the exemplar's directory, would a reader notice?
- Does the decomposition feel inevitable, or arbitrary?
- If you removed any line, would a reviewer miss it?

If the answer to any of those is "no" or "I'd notice," flag the file for another pass.
