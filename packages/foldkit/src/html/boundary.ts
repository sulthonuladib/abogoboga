/** Per-runtime registry of Submodel wrapping descriptors. The runtime
 *  creates one of these in `start` and reuses it across renders.
 *  `h.submodel` writes into `wraps` each render and attaches a snabbdom
 *  `destroy` hook that calls `deregisterBoundaryWrap` when the
 *  corresponding vnode is removed from the DOM tree. The dispatch path
 *  reads from `wraps` at event-fire time.
 *
 *  `boundaryDispatches` caches per-(outerDispatch, boundaryId) dispatcher
 *  closures so `requireDispatch` returns a stable reference across
 *  repeated calls with the same outerDispatch (necessary for
 *  `createLazy`'s dispatch-identity check). Keyed by outerDispatch as a
 *  WeakMap so DevTools jump-to renders with a different
 *  outerDispatch (typically a noOpDispatch that drops messages) get
 *  their own per-boundary cache. Without this two-level keying, a
 *  dispatcher created during a live render would still close over the
 *  live outerDispatch after a jump-to and silently mutate the live app.
 *
 *  `mountWraps` provides the corresponding ownership-aware path for Mount
 *  results. Unlike event handlers, a surviving live Mount can emit while a
 *  replay render's wraps occupy `wraps`. Its dispatcher therefore reads only
 *  the wraps registered by renders with the same root Mount dispatcher, while
 *  still seeing replacements from later live renders. `mountWrapOwners`
 *  records every owner that has occupied a boundary so its final destroy hook
 *  can clear entries whose earlier hooks were replaced by in-place patches.
 *
 *  `seenThisRender` tracks boundaries marked alive during the current
 *  render for duplicate-slotId detection: two `h.submodel` calls
 *  inside the same parent boundary must use different `slotId`s.
 *  Values are the call site captured at register time, surfaced when a
 *  second register collides so both locations land in the throw
 *  message. The map is cleared at the start of each render via
 *  `beginRender`. Boundaries behind a `createLazy`/`createKeyedLazy`
 *  cache hit are replayed into this map via
 *  {@link restoreBoundaryWrapsForLazyHit} so the duplicate-slotId guard
 *  catches collisions against memoized siblings, not just against siblings
 *  that re-ran this frame. It does not drive pruning; VNode destroy hooks
 *  remove a descriptor only when it is still the current entry, so an old
 *  root cannot delete a same-cycle remount.
 *
 *  `lazyTrackingStack` is a stack of maps used by `createLazy` and
 *  `createKeyedLazy` to capture which boundary registrations were marked alive
 *  during the wrapped function's first execution. On a later cache
 *  hit, the lazy helper replays the captured ids into
 *  `seenThisRender` so the duplicate-slotId guard sees them. Each
 *  active lazy invocation pushes its own map; `registerBoundaryWrap`
 *  and `restoreBoundaryWrapsForLazyHit` write to every map on the stack so an
 *  outer lazy correctly captures registrations contributed by inner lazies it
 *  wraps. The registration snapshot also lets a cache hit restore wrapping
 *  descriptors after its cached VNode was removed and later reinserted.
 *
 *  `boundaryWrapTransactionLog` and `activeBoundaryWrapTransaction` make a
 *  Submodel view's registration and lazy-cache writes transactional. If that
 *  view throws or returns `null`, every nested registration and cache entry it
 *  produced is restored because none of those VNodes will reach snabbdom and
 *  run its destroy hook. */
