# Toast

## Overview

A stack of transient notifications positioned along an edge of the viewport. Each entry has its own enter and leave animation and hover state. Non-sticky entries have independent auto-dismiss timers that pause on hover. Swipe-to-dismiss is opt-in for the container. Keep the container at the app root and add entries with `Toast.show`.

Toast is parameterized on a payload Schema that you provide. The component owns entry IDs, variants, animations, optional dismiss timers, hover state, and swipe state. Your payload holds the content rendered by `entryToView`. `Toast.make(PayloadSchema)` returns a module whose Model, helpers, and view are bound to that payload type.

## Examples

Click a variant to add a toast. Hover a non-sticky toast to pause its auto-dismiss; move away and the timer restarts. Drag a toast right to dismiss it. If you release after more than 40px, it continues off-screen; otherwise it animates back. Press Escape while dragging to cancel.

## Styling

Toast supplies layout and gesture styles but leaves the appearance to you. Its container has fixed positioning and a flex layout that stacks entries according to `position`. Use `containerClassName`, `entryClassName`, and `entryToView` for your styling; `data-variant` is available for per-variant CSS.

Each entry’s enter and leave phases flow through [Animation](/ui/animation). Style the entry wrapper with CSS transitions or keyframe animations; each phase waits for those animations to finish.

## Gestures

Swipe is pointer-driven and opt-in. Pass `swipeToDismiss` to `Toast.init`. For example: `{}` enables a rightward swipe with a 40px threshold, `{ threshold: 120 }` requires a longer swipe, and `{ direction: 'Left' }` enables a leftward swipe. Without it, `Toast.view` attaches no `pointerdown` handler or `touch-action` restriction. Direction is independent of `position`, so configure it explicitly for a left-anchored stack.

With swipe enabled, `Toast.view` handles `pointerdown` on each entry. Wire `Toast.subscriptions` at the app root with `Subscription.lift(Toast.subscriptions)` to track `pointermove`, `pointerup`, and `pointercancel` even when the pointer leaves the entry. Without those subscriptions, a drag cannot finish. Escape cancels active drags. While dragging, Toast prevents text selection and shows the grabbing cursor. The example above includes the lift; see also [Toast subscriptions in the demo app](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/blob/main/packages/website/src/page/ui/subscriptions.ts).

Presses on buttons, links, form controls, and editable elements do not start a swipe, so a close button keeps its normal pointer behavior. To make text selectable with a mouse or pen, put `data-toast-swipe-ignore` on a span around the text, as the demo does. A touch can still start a swipe over that text. Other areas of the entry remain draggable.

While dragging, the entry follows the pointer only in the configured direction; movement in the opposite direction is clamped to zero. `Toast.view` sets `data-swipe="move"` and the entry's inline `translate` offset. The `translate` property composes with any `transform` animation you apply. Dismissal depends on release distance, not velocity. Releasing more than the threshold sets `data-swipe="end"`, holds the release offset until leave animation starts, then targets `100vw` or `-100vw` to carry the entry off-screen before `DismissedToast` fires.

Releasing at or below the threshold, or cancelling with Escape, returns the entry to zero offset and resumes auto-dismiss when applicable. Toast holds `data-swipe="settling"` for 150ms (`SWIPE_SETTLE_DURATION`) after either case. Add a `translate` transition for the snap-back and exit, as the demos do:

::Snippet{name="uiToastSwipeStyles" label="swipe transition styles"}

While an entry is translated, the view exposes its drag or release offset as `--toast-swipe-move-x`. You can use it to style an action background behind the moving entry.

| Attribute         | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-variant`    | Present on each entry, with the variant value (Info, Success, Warning, Error). Use for per-variant CSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `data-enter`      | Present on an entry while its enter animation runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `data-leave`      | Present on an entry while its leave animation runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `data-closed`     | Present on an entry at the closed extreme of its enter or leave animation. Pair with data-enter or data-leave to drive the starting and ending CSS states.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `data-transition` | Present on an entry while either animation runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `data-swipe`      | `move` while an entry is being dragged, `settling` while a short or cancelled swipe returns to rest, and `end` while a successful swipe exits. The view positions the entry with the inline `translate` property (which composes with your `transform` animations) and exposes the pointer offset as `--toast-swipe-move-x` for custom styling. |

## Accessibility

The container has `role="region"` and `aria-live="polite"`. It stays in the DOM when empty so screen readers can observe notifications added later. Each entry has `aria-atomic="true"` and receives `role="status"` for Info and Success or `role="alert"` for Warning and Error. Auto-dismiss pauses on pointer hover and while dragging. Swipe and close-button dismissal both use the leave animation and emit `DismissedToast` when the entry is removed.

## API Reference

### InitConfig {#init-config}

Configuration object passed to `Toast.init()`.

| Name              | Type                                                    | Default               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | `string`                                                | —                     | Unique ID for the toast container.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `defaultDuration` | `Duration.Input`                                        | `Duration.seconds(4)` | Auto-dismiss duration for a `Toast.show` call without its own `duration` or `sticky: true`. Accepts any Effect Duration input; a bare number means milliseconds.                                                                   |
| `swipeToDismiss`  | `{ threshold?: number; direction?: 'Left' \| 'Right' }` | —                     | Opts the container into swipe-to-dismiss. Omit it to leave swipe disabled. Defaults to a rightward 40px threshold. Set `threshold` for the dismissal distance and `direction: 'Left'` for a leftward swipe. Applies per container. |

### ShowInput {#show-input}

Input shape for `Toast.show(model, input)`.

| Name       | Type                                          | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payload`  | `A (your payload type)`                       | —        | Content for this entry, in the shape you supplied to `Toast.make`. Toast passes it to your `entryToView` callback without reading it.                                                                                       |
| `variant`  | `'Info' \| 'Success' \| 'Warning' \| 'Error'` | `'Info'` | Semantic category. Maps to data-variant for styling and to role=status (Info, Success) or role=alert (Warning, Error) for accessibility. The only content-adjacent field the component owns. Everything else is in payload. |
| `duration` | `Duration.Input`                              | —        | Overrides the container's defaultDuration for this entry. No auto-dismiss timer is scheduled when `sticky: true`.                                                                                                           |
| `sticky`   | `boolean`                                     | `false`  | When true, the entry does not auto-dismiss. It can still be closed with the close button, an enabled swipe, or `Toast.dismiss`.                                                                                             |

### ViewInputs {#view-config}

Pass these fields in the `viewInputs` of `h.submodel({ view: Toast.view, ... })`. Pass the Toast Model and `toParentMessage` to `h.submodel` itself, as shown in the example above.

| Name                 | Type                                                                                        | Default           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `position`           | `'TopLeft' \| 'TopCenter' \| 'TopRight' \| 'BottomLeft' \| 'BottomCenter' \| 'BottomRight'` | —                 | Where the toast viewport is anchored on the screen.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `entryToView`        | `(entry: typeof Toast.Entry.Type, handlers: EntryHandlers) => Html`                         | —                 | Renders content inside the entry `<div>`, which Toast owns along with its role, lifecycle handlers, and data attributes. Spread `handlers.dismiss` onto a close button to let users dismiss the entry. |
| `ariaLabel`          | `string`                                                                                    | `'Notifications'` | aria-label on the container region.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `containerClassName` | `string`                                                                                    | —                 | CSS class for the container `<div>`.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `entryClassName`     | `string`                                                                                    | —                 | CSS class applied to every entry `<div>`.                                                                                                                                                              |

### Programmatic Helpers

Toast helpers are child entry points. Fold `show` and `dismiss` with `Update.foldChild` because they take additional input. Fold `dismissAll` with `Update.foldChildStep`.

| Name         | Type                                                                                          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `show`       | `(model: Model, input: ShowInput) => Update.ReturnWithOutMessage<Model, Message, OutMessage>` | —       | Adds a new toast entry. Fold it from any parent handler that needs to surface a notification. Returns the next Model plus Commands for the enter animation and, unless sticky, auto-dismiss. |
| `dismiss`    | `(model: Model, entryId: string) => Update.ReturnWithOutMessage<Model, Message, OutMessage>`  | —       | Begins dismissing a specific entry. Calling it for an entry that is already leaving or has been removed is a no-op.                                                                          |
| `dismissAll` | `(model: Model) => Update.ReturnWithOutMessage<Model, Message, OutMessage>`                   | —       | Begins dismissing every currently-visible entry.                                                                                                                                             |

### Subscriptions

Toast exposes `Toast.subscriptions` with `swipePointer` and `swipeEscape`. Lift them once at the app root so pointer tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the entry. The [example above](#examples) shows the lift alongside the Toast Model and Message, and the [demo app](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/blob/main/packages/website/src/page/ui/subscriptions.ts) shows it in context.

Without the lift the view still renders `data-swipe="move"` for the initial `pointerdown`, but `pointermove` and `pointerup` never reach the update and the gesture cannot complete.

If you render the Toast Model without `Toast.view`, you own the entry markup, accessibility roles, `pointerdown` handler, and swipe styling. Read the pointer offset with `Toast.swipeOffset(entry.swipeState)` and apply the `translate` property yourself. Mirror the `data-swipe` phases: `move` while the entry is `Dragging`, `settling` while it is `Settling`, and `end` while it is `Dismissing`. In the `end` phase, retain the offset at `LeaveStart`, then move toward `100vw` or `-100vw` at `LeaveAnimating` according to the swipe direction. By contrast, `entryToView` only renders content inside the `<div>` wrapper owned by `Toast.view`.

### OutMessage {#out-message}

Messages emitted to the parent through the optional `outMessage` field. Fold the OutMessage in the `foldOutMessage` of your [`Update.foldChild`](/core/submodel#fold-child) config.

| Name             | Type                   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DismissedToast` | `{ payload: Payload }` | —       | Emitted when an entry finishes its leave animation and is removed from the Model. It carries the payload from your `Payload` Schema. Handle it in `foldOutMessage` to update domain state or return an analytics Command. It reports removal, not the initial dismiss request. |
