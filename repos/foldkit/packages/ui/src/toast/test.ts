/** Builds a `Story.Command.resolveAll` step that drains a single toast
 *  entry's full animation and dismiss lifecycle. Resolving these Commands in
 *  order takes a freshly shown entry from its enter animation through
 *  auto-dismiss and its exit animation, ending with the entry removed from the
 *  stack and the `DismissedToast` OutMessage emitted.
 *
 *  Showing a toast via `Toast.show` emits a multi-step lifecycle that a Story
 *  test must resolve in full or the story fails on leftover Commands. The
 *  steps are:
 *
 *  - enter animation: `WaitForPaint` then `CompletedWaitForPaint`
 *  - enter settle: `WaitForAnimationSettled` then `EndedAnimation`
 *  - auto-dismiss: `WaitBeforeDismissal` then
 *    `CompletedWaitBeforeDismissal`
 *  - exit animation: `WaitForPaint` then `CompletedWaitForPaint`
 *  - exit settle: `WaitForAnimationSettled` then `EndedAnimation`
 *
 *  Each step resolves with the child's raw result Message. `resolveAll` replays
 *  the matched Command's own recorded wrapping, so a parent that embeds the
 *  toast Submodel drains the same way without restating its `Got*` lift.
 *
 *  @example
 *  ```ts
 *  Story.story(
 *    update,
 *    Story.given(model),
 *    Story.message(ClickedSave()),
 *    Toast.test.drainEntry({ entryId: 'toast-entry-0' }),
 *  )
 *  ```
