# Anchor

## Overview

Anchor is the positioning runtime the floating components are built on. [Listbox](/ui/listbox), [Combobox](/ui/combobox), [Menu](/ui/menu), [Popover](/ui/popover), and [Tooltip](/ui/tooltip) hand their `anchor` prop straight to it, and [Date Picker](/ui/date-picker) forwards its own through Popover. It wraps [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com), adding the portaling, focus choreography, and styling hooks those components share.

It is exported so you can build an anchored component Foldkit does not ship. If one of the six above fits, use it. Reach for this module when the panel you need differs structurally from all of them, for example a virtualized list with group headers, or a multi-select that stages changes against an open-time baseline and commits them with a Done action.

::Snippet{name="uiAnchorExports" label="Anchor imports"}

The module is also exported from the root barrel, as `import { Anchor } from '@foldkit/ui'`.

## Positioning a Panel

`anchorSetup` is a plain DOM function. It takes the element and a config, and returns a cleanup. An element exists in the rendered tree and `execute` uses that element to do DOM work, so [Mount](/core/mount) is the primitive that owns it. `Mount.define` covers the one-shot acquire-with-cleanup shape.

::Snippet{name="uiAnchorBasic" label="anchored panel"}

Two details decide whether the panel behaves:

The trigger needs a stable id. `anchorSetup` resolves the button by `buttonId` through the element's own root, so a panel rendered inside a shadow root finds a trigger in that same shadow root. A document-scoped lookup would not. If the id does not resolve, or the trigger or panel is not an HTML element, `anchorSetup` reports the specific problem to the console and returns a cleanup that does nothing. The panel remains hidden. A failed positioning tick also reports an error; the panel stays hidden until a later tick succeeds.

The panel must start hidden. `anchorSetup` clears `visibility` after the first position resolves, which means the element is expected to render at `visibility: hidden`. Skip it and the panel paints at the top left corner for a frame before Floating UI places it.

Mount args are captured at mount, not refreshed across renders. A changed `anchor` value does not reach a running Mount, so unmount and remount the panel when the config has to change.

## Portaling

`anchorSetup` portals the panel itself. `AnchorConfig.portal` defaults to `true`, which relocates the element into a portal root so it escapes any ancestor stacking context or `overflow: hidden`. Pass `portal: false` to leave the panel where it was rendered.

`portalToContainingRoot` is the same relocation as a standalone function, for the elements `anchorSetup` does not touch. For a click-outside backdrop, use `portalBackdrop` instead, described below. Popover, Listbox, Menu, and Combobox each portal their backdrop through a second Mount. Give yours its own `Mount.define`, since [one element takes one Mount](/core/mount).

The portal root is a shared `foldkit-portal-root` div in the containing root. The containing root is the shadow root when the app is mounted inside one, and `document.body` otherwise, so a portaled panel keeps that root's scoped styles. The portal root div is prepended rather than appended, which keeps component wrappers painting above a backdrop and leaves click-outside detection working.

An element inside a `<dialog>` is portaled into that dialog instead. Say a Listbox sits in a [Dialog](/ui/dialog). Portaled to `document.body`, its panel would be drawn behind the dialog, and the Dialog's modal isolation would make it inert. So the panel goes into a div marked `data-foldkit-portal-root`, appended as the dialog's last child. There it renders above the dialog's content and stays interactive. The div is removed once nothing is portaled into it.

A backdrop inside a dialog does not go into that div. Appended after the dialog's content, it would cover the trigger too, and a click in a Combobox input would close the list instead of placing the cursor. `portalBackdrop` moves the backdrop to directly before the element it was rendered in, which is the positioned wrapper that holds the trigger. The backdrop then covers the rest of the dialog, and the wrapper stays above it. When you render a Popover backdrop yourself, put it inside that wrapper. Some CSS on an ancestor between the wrapper and the dialog confines the backdrop to that ancestor. This happens when the ancestor becomes the containing block for fixed-position elements, for example through `transform`, `scale`, `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, or `container-type`. A click outside that ancestor then misses the backdrop, so the overlay stays open. If the click also lands outside the dialog panel, it reaches the Dialog's own backdrop and closes the whole dialog.

## What Anchor Writes to Your Element {#managed-styles}

Anchor writes the following while the Mount is alive. Except where a row says otherwise, whatever you set is overwritten. `data-placement`, `overflow-y`, `overscroll-behavior`, `--arrow-x`, and `--arrow-y` are removed on unmount; the other inline styles are left on the element, which is normally invisible because the element unmounts with the Mount.

| Property                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `left` / `top`                       | The resolved position, recomputed on scroll, resize, and layout shift.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `visibility`                         | Cleared once the first position resolves. Render the element at `visibility: hidden`.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `max-height`                         | The height available in the viewport, so a long panel scrolls instead of overflowing. Always written, including when `arrowId` resolves and the panel scrolls through a container of your own.                                        |
| `overflow-y` / `overscroll-behavior` | Set to `auto` and `none`, so a scrolled panel does not chain its scroll to the page. Neither is written once `arrowId` resolves, because a scrolling panel clips on both axes and would erase the arrow. Both are removed on cleanup. |
| `--button-width`                     | The trigger's width as a custom property. Use it to match panel width to trigger width in CSS.                                                                                                                                        |
| `--arrow-x` / `--arrow-y`            | The arrow's offset along the panel edge, published only when `arrowId` resolves. One axis per placement; the other is reset to `initial`, so an ancestor's value cannot inherit into the arrow. Both are removed on cleanup.          |
| `position`                           | Set to `fixed` only inside a shadow root, where the absolute strategy mis-measures against the light-DOM host. Otherwise the element keeps the `position: absolute` you gave it.                                                      |
| `data-placement`                     | The side the panel currently sits on: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`. Removed on cleanup.                                                                                                                                        |

`data-placement` is the hook for styling by side, for example an arrow that flips with the panel. With `isPlacementLocked: true` it holds the side the first positioning picked and stays there.

## Reach for a Component First

Building on Anchor means owning the parts the components already handle: open and closed state, click-outside dismissal, Escape handling, focus return, ARIA wiring, and enter and leave animation. Anchor covers positioning and portaling, and nothing above them.

[Popover](/ui/popover) is the closest thing to a blank panel Foldkit ships. It takes arbitrary content, handles dismissal and focus, and leaves the inside to you. Check that it does not fit before writing your own.

## API Reference

### anchorSetup {#anchor-setup}

`(element: Element, config: SetupConfig) => () => void`

Positions an HTML element against the HTML trigger named by `config.buttonId`, portals it unless `anchor.portal` is `false`, and returns a cleanup. A missing trigger or non-HTML element is reported to the console, and no positioning starts. Call it inside `Effect.sync` in a Mount and register the cleanup with `Effect.acquireRelease`.

### AnchorConfig {#anchor-config}

Static positioning options. Every field is optional. This is the same Schema the six components accept as their `anchor` prop, and it is available as a value here rather than as a type alone.

| Name                | Type        | Default          | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `placement`         | `Placement` | `'bottom-start'` | Preferred side and alignment. Floating UI flips to the opposite side when the preferred one does not fit, unless `isPlacementLocked` is set.                                        |
| `gap`               | `number`    | `0`              | Distance in pixels between the trigger and the panel, along the placement axis.                                                                                                     |
| `offset`            | `number`    | `0`              | Shift in pixels along the cross axis, for nudging the panel sideways from its alignment.                                                                                            |
| `padding`           | `Padding`   | `0`              | Minimum distance to the viewport edge, honored by shift, the height calculation, and flip while placement is unlocked. A number applies to all sides; an object sets them per side. |
| `portal`            | `boolean`   | `true`           | Relocates the panel into the portal root so it escapes ancestor clipping and stacking contexts. Inside a `<dialog>`, the portal root is inside that dialog.                         |
| `isPlacementLocked` | `boolean`   | `false`          | Keeps the side the first positioning resolves, dropping flip from every later update. Use it when a panel that flips mid-interaction reads as a jump.                               |

### SetupConfig {#setup-config}

The second argument to `anchorSetup`.

| Name                 | Type           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buttonId`           | `string`       | —       | Id of the trigger to position against. Resolved through the element's own root, so it works inside a shadow root. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `anchor`             | `AnchorConfig` | —       | The static positioning options above. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `interceptTab`       | `boolean`      | `true`  | Returns focus to the trigger when Tab is pressed inside a portaled panel. Set it to `false` when the panel holds focusable content Tab should move through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `focusAfterPosition` | `boolean`      | `false` | Focuses the panel once the first position resolves, deferred a frame so the element is painted first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `focusSelector`      | `string`       | —       | Focuses a descendant matching this selector instead of the panel itself, for example a grid inside a panel. Only read when `focusAfterPosition` is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `arrowId`            | `string`       | —       | Id of an arrow element inside the panel, resolved through the element's own root. When it resolves, Anchor computes the arrow's offset along the panel edge, publishes it as `--arrow-x` and `--arrow-y`, and stops making the panel a scroll container. Any element type works, including `<svg>`. With no id, an id that resolves to nothing, or an id that resolves to an element outside the panel, no arrow work happens at all. |
| `arrowPadding`       | `number`       | `0`     | Distance in pixels the arrow keeps from the panel's corners. Separate from `anchor.padding`, which is the viewport padding that flip, shift, and the height calculation consume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### portalToContainingRoot {#portal-to-containing-root}

`(element: Element) => () => void`

Relocates an element into the portal root and returns a cleanup that removes it. The portal root is inside the enclosing `<dialog>` when there is one, and the shared `foldkit-portal-root` div within the containing root otherwise. The cleanup also removes a dialog's portal root once it is empty. Use it for elements outside the anchored panel, since `anchorSetup` already portals the panel unless `portal: false` says otherwise. For a click-outside backdrop, use `portalBackdrop`.

### portalBackdrop {#portal-backdrop}

`(element: Element) => () => void`

Relocates a click-outside backdrop and returns a cleanup that removes it. Outside a `<dialog>`, it does what `portalToContainingRoot` does. Inside one, it moves the backdrop to directly before the element it was rendered in, so the backdrop covers the dialog's content while the positioned wrapper that holds the trigger stays above it. A backdrop rendered directly in the dialog goes into the dialog's portal root. While the backdrop sits before the wrapper, it is a sibling of the wrapper, so sibling-based selectors such as `:first-child` or Tailwind's `divide-y` count it.

### Placement and Padding

`Placement` is a Schema over the twelve Floating UI placements: a side (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`), optionally suffixed with `-start` or `-end`.

`Padding` is a Schema over a uniform `number` or a partial per-side object with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. Both are exported so an `AnchorConfig` can be described from this subpath alone.
